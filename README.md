# virtual_machine WIP

Kind of a toy stack based virtual machine implementation for interest / curiosity.

see tests for examples of syntax etc.

Inspired by the https://www.nand2tetris.org/ website. This is not one of the tasks there, I just implemented an emulator for the virtual machine they describe because it looked fun and I got something out of it
